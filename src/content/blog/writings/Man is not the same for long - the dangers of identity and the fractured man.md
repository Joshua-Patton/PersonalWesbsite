If I asked you "who your are?" you would probably respond with your occupation. You would say I am a painter, I am a accountant, I am a guitarist. But it is obvious that this not who you are. Perhaps instead you say "I am Christian" or " i am Muslim, maybe you respond with your name, "I am John" or "I am James" but this also misses the mark, your name is a label, a notation, at best an arrow pointing towards the real you.
Before reading further, how would you answer? *who are you?* 

The reason this question is so apparently difficult to answer honestly is because we are firstly not unified conversely we are many competing and often contradicting desires, hopes and fears being acted out by a single body. Secondly we are ultimately always changing, adapting to our surroundings and a world which itself never sits still, our 

We answer with our occupation, religion or social group because we identify with it, either they represent certain ambitions and virtues which we wish to hold - this is identifying with the future: which is a projection of ourselves and not itself us. Or they represent our past in some way, something we have done or experienced - this is identifying with our past selves: which is also not us, but instead a shadow of us.

I do not argue against the existence of the self, obviously you feel and think and react in a way unique to you, there is an 'I' deep down in the very soul of your naked being, although it may at times seem ineffable. But rather my argument stands as against the need to identify ourselves strongly which comes from a need to communicate and justify our existence. I believe the rigidity of identity stops true being, and clouds us in moments of true aspiration. 

If we are to ever answer this question "who are we?" we must first stop trying to consider ourselves as absolute and solid rather than the constantly changing objects we are. You are not your past actions although they influence you, you are also not your ambitions although they might inspire you. Stop trying to clench on identity, let go and decide to be, feel the weight of your body on your feet, feel how the anger caused slowly passes over your body in moment of heat, feel how one thought leads to another. 

Only by letting go of our identity can we achieve the creativity needed to answer such a question, and forgot trying to communicate it to others, this is a secret only yourself is privy.
