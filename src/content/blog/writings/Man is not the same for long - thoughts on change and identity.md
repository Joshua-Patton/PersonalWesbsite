# An addiction to identity - tribes and tribulation
If you ask a person sincerely who they are, they will most likely speak of their work, what they do to earn money, they will say I am an accountant for this firm, a painter for this gallery or a electrician in this city. Of course a person is not nescessarily his occupation, but what else might an answer be? Some will say I am "Luke", I am 'John' or I am 'Josh' , but that is also not who they are, that is a name, notion or label - a way to point to them. 

> How would you answer?

Why does this question which seems to simple and central, evade our grasp - is there a problem with how the question is framed, what might a 'good' answer look like?
