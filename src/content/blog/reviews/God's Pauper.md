description: Fictionalised biography of Francis of Assisi.
---
The book follows the life of St Francis of Assisi, the famous founder of the Franciscan friars. I believe Nikos must of taken inspiration from the little flowers of St Francis, a historical compendium of the stories of Francis originally published only about 100 years after his death. However Kazantzakis takes some poetic liberty and embellishes the myth of the saint and his original disciples. I can almost equant the story to a sort of biblical Don Quixote, in this sense I would say it is as Miguel de Cervantes wrote the bible - however it is written in the perspective of Sancho Panza, or this books equivalent 'brother Leo'.  In this interpretation the book can be read secularly. Despite some miracles,  the words of God are never written down from the perspective of brother Leo, and so considering him the gullible narrator you may consider this book the overestimated achievements of an insane man. I find this reading the most fascinating as it doesn't distance the man Francis from us by divine aspiration - we consider that at the core of Francis's dramatic poverty, machoistic tendencies and submission - is the everlasting human need to give and receive unconditional love.
